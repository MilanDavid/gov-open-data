# GovOpenData

Open Data of Republic of Serbia from this link http://opendata.mpn.gov.rs/

I used http requests to get json data and display it to data table. If you select rows it will show data in bar chart for easy comparison.

NOTE: You will have to enable unsecure script in Chrome for application to work. This is b/c open data endpoints are not secure with SSL.
